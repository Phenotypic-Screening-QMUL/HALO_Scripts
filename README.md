# HALO Scripts

HALO imaging software is a powerful digital pathology platform developed by Indica Labs. It is designed for quantitative analysis of whole slide tissue images.

It is the primary software within the facility for the assessment and quantification of Cell DIVE images.

HALO allows complex analysis of whole samples, annotated regions and single cell targets - including generation of phenotypes for postive/negative classification.

HALO can also be used for INCA images but a process must be gone through to generate the afi container files.
